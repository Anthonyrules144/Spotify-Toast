# Spotify-Toast [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/Anthonyrules144/Spotify-Toast.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/Anthonyrules144/Spotify-Toast)
An always on-top toast application for your current song, artist, time, and album art

# WARNING
## This is the Linux / Mac OS version for Spotify-Toast. I made this in Electron as a remake and it's no where near done. This is going to be a pure replica of the normal version for Windows.

# How to use
Duplicate the repo, put it anywhere you want. <br/>
Make sure you have Node and NPM installed. I use latest.<br/>
Type in `NPM install`, and it should get all the stuff required.<br/>
Once everything is in place, just use `NPM start` to start it.<br/>
When the application becomes more done, I will release for Linux and Mac OS natively in the releases tab.

# Why did I make this?
Some of the applications that are used for Spotify similar to this aren't updated to todays standards. So I figured, why not make my own.
