# Why did I make this?
Some of the applications that are used for Spotify similar to this aren't updated to todays standards. So I figured, why not make my own.

# How to use
Simple! Just open the application, and it's ready to go as long as you have Spotify open! <br/>
You can also access the Options menu by clicking the version # in the bottom right, or double clicking the tray icon, or pressing CTRL-O while the app is active <br/>
If your settings somehow miraculously dissapear, just delete the config

# Todo
* Make an option for an actual toast to show up on screen when song changes
* Make the app better looking in general
* Make the app work on Linux, ~~possibly mac?~~
* Fixing any [issues](https://github.com/Anthonyrules144/Spotify-Toast/issues) that the application has
