# Spotify-Toast
An always on-top toast application for your current song, artist, time, and album art

# Why did I make this?
Some of the applications that are used for spotify similar to this aren't updated to todays standards. So I figured, why not make my own.

# How to use
Simple! Just open the application, and it's ready to go as long as you have spotify open! <br/>
You can also access the Options menu by clicking the version # in the bottom right <br/>
If your settings somehow miraculously dissapear, just delete the config

# Todo
* Make an option for an actual toast to show up on screen when song changes
* Make the app better looking in general
* Make the app work on Linux, ~~possibly mac?~~
* Fixing any [issues](https://github.com/Anthonyrules144/Spotify-Toast/issues) that the application has

### Interested in the source code?
I used SpotifyAPI-Net, you can find it [here](https://github.com/johnnycrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET)<br/>
You can also do whatever you want with my code, just give me credit, I'd appreciate it.
