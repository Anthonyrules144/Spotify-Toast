# Spotify-Toast
An always on-top toast application for your current song, artist, time, and album art

# Why did I make this?
Some of the applications that are used for spotify similar to this aren't updated to todays standards. So I figured, why not make my own.

# Interested in the source code?
> I used SpotifyAPI-Net, you can find it [here](https://github.com/johnnycrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET), You can also do whatever you want with my code, just give me credit, I'd appreciate it.
