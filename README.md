# Why did I make this?
Some of the applications that are used for Spotify similar to this aren't updated to todays standards. So I figured, why not make my own.

# How to use
Simple! Just open the application, and it's ready to go as long as you have Spotify open! <br/>
You can also access the Options menu by clicking the version # in the bottom right, or double clicking the tray icon, or pressing CTRL-O while the app is active <br/>
If your settings somehow miraculously dissapear or mess up, just delete the config<br/>
How do you open the options menu via Toast Mode? Double click the purple icon in your task bar
